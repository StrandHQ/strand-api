I thought it would be simple to transition to the web (since I'm trying to make this into something my coworkers can easily access), but so far it has proved to be quite difficult. I finally got to the point where I'm submitting and reading the file, but now I realize every time I submit the same csv file, the script gets different data. Anyone know what's happening here? It sounds like a buffer issue but I don't know the proper way to upload and parse a text file via POST.\r\n\r\n<https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7k22zs/having_an_issue_with_reading_a_text_file_that_was/>",

    "description": "Diving into responsive web design with React for the first time. Wondering if my approach is an anti-pattern in any way, since it doesn\u2019t seem super common: for each view in my app, I\u2019m creating a \u201ccontainer\u201d component (e.g. `AppDashboard`) that uses a series of material-ui\u2019s `&lt;Hidden&gt;` component to basically do a switch statement across a bunch of child components that each lay out a different screen size, e.g. `AppDashboardDesktop` vs. `AppDashboardMobile`. I\u2019m separately extracting out all common children-of-children components, strings of text, etc so there\u2019s little code duplication between those two child components. I think this makes it a lot easier to manage the different layouts that end up pieced together with material-ui `&lt;Grid&gt;` components - you don\u2019t mess up the mobile view if you make changes to the desktop view. But it seems the more common approach would be to use just one file, and do e.g. `&lt;Grid sm={8} md={4} xl={3}&gt;`. Is this just the old webdev non-React way of thinking, or am I missing something?",

Would like to further leverage CircleCI to continuously deploy successful builds to a staging environment on AWS ECS with the option to manually deploy to production if staging was successful. In CircleCI v2.0, workflows seem to be the best practice. Working hypothesis is to have a workflow that deploys to staging and holds for approval before deploying to production. The deploy-to-staging and deploy-to-production jobs would each have bash scripts that use AWS\u2019s CLI. If anyone has experience here or if there is a more elegant solution via CircleCI than the bash scripts, would love to hear.",

    "description": "I admit in advance that this is a very weird problem. I am still posting it hoping someone could figure out whats wrong.\r\nI am trying to access a webpage, url - <https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/payment_options>. I can open it using Google Chrome, Firefox and Python Requests as well.\r\nNow, I want to access the same page using a dedicated proxy from stormproxies. I follow the proxy setup on Firefox and Chrome, as well as use those in Requests code. The webpage opens up well in Firefox, but not in Chrome. It just keeps on waiting for the sever to respond. Same thing happens with Requests code. It times out if I use a timeout parameter.\r\n\r\nHere is the Requests code I am using:\r\n```import requests\r\n\r\nproxy = '&lt;proxy&gt;'\r\nproxies = {'http': 'http://{}'.format(proxy), 'https': 'http://{}'.format(proxy)}\r\n\r\n\r\nheaders = {\r\n    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8',\r\n    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',\r\n    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',\r\n    'Cache-Control': 'max-age=0',\r\n    'Connection': 'keep-alive',\r\n    'Host': '<http://www.ticketmaster.com|www.ticketmaster.com>',\r\n    'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests': '1',\r\n    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36'\r\n}\r\n\r\ns = requests.session()\r\ns.headers.update(headers)\r\n# s.proxies.update(proxies)\r\nurl = '<https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/payment_options>'\r\nr = s.get(url, timeout=30)\r\nprint(r.content.decode())```\r\n\r\nThis code would work fine, but as soon as you uncomment the line `s.proxies.update(proxies)`, it would throw TimeoutException.\r\n\r\nThe bigger issue here is that even Google Chrome isnt working.\r\nThe only reasons I could figure out is that Firefox has its own Proxy setup, but Google Chrome rather uses Windows Internet Explorer proxy settings and security settings.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of you have come across this or if know a solution.",

    "title": "JavaScript single request to two different ports",
    "description": "I'm testing a script where one function makes an http request and is then called in another function.\r\nThe first function is:\r\n```export function getFeedData (sub) {\r\n    if (getFeedId(sub) === 2) {\r\n        return axios.get('<http://localhost:4000>').then((data) =&gt; \r\nJSON.parse(data));\r\n    }\r\n}```\r\nAnd the second is:\r\n```export function isDelay (sub, stop) {\r\n    return getFeedData(sub).then((data) =&gt; {\r\n        return data.entity.filter((entityObj) =&gt; {\r\n            return entityObj.stop_time_update !== undefined;\r\n        });\r\n    }).then((newData) =&gt;  {\r\n        console.log(newData);\r\n    }).catch((err) =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(err);\r\n    });\r\n}```\r\nThe reason they're two different functions is that the second will eventually be longer, and I wanted to separate everything out for the sake of simplicity and making my code a bit more declarative.\r\nThe tests for these functions currently look like this:\r\n```import express from 'express';\r\nimport { getFeedId, getFeedData, reverseStop, isDelay } from \r\n'../mocks/apiMock';\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\napp.use(express.static('../mocks/MockData.json'));\r\n\r\nit('returns json data', (done) =&gt; {\r\n    app.listen(4000, function () {\r\n        expect.assertions(2);\r\n        return getFeedData('L').then((data) =&gt; {\r\n            expect(data).toBeDefined();\r\n            expect(data.header.gtfs_realtime_version).toBe('1.0');\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n    done();\r\n});\r\n\r\nit('returns either the delay or time until the next train' , (done) \r\n=&gt; {\r\n    app.listen(4000, function () {\r\n        isDelay('L', 'Lorimer St');\r\n    });\r\n    done();\r\n});```\r\nThat second test doesn't run because it's trying to listen on a port that's already occupied.\r\nThe solution I had in mind would be to pass `app.listen()` `0` as its first parameter so it listens on a random port. However, I don't know how I could get my axios request to request that specific port. Is there a way to do this? Or perhaps a better solution to my problem?",
